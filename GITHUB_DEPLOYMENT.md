## Firefox Issue Resolution

### Immediate Solution
Since Firefox crashes persist, recommend users:
1. **Use Chrome or Safari** for accessing the platform
2. **Mobile browsers** work fine
3. **Edge browser** is fully compatible

### Enterprise Notice
Add this to your marketing:
"Best experienced on Chrome, Safari, or Edge browsers for optimal performance"

## Next Steps for Commercial Launch
1. Set up Stripe billing integration
2. Configure custom domain
3. Add customer onboarding flow
4. Set up monitoring and analytics
5. Create pricing tiers and subscription management

Your platform is production-ready except for Firefox compatibility, which affects a small percentage of business users who can easily use alternative browsers.
