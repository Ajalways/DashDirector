# Firefox Crash Analysis & Resolution

## Crash Details
**Error**: `MOZ_RELEASE_ASSERT(ClientMatchPrincipalInfo(mClientInfo.PrincipalInfo(), aServiceWorker.PrincipalInfo()))`

**Root Cause**: Firefox Service Worker internal crash - not related to our application code but to Firefox's Service Worker implementation.

## Analysis
- This is a Firefox-specific crash in the Service Worker subsystem
- Occurs when there's a mismatch in principal information between client and service worker
- Memory usage was at 76% which may contribute to the issue
- Not caused by our build process or bundle size

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Service Worker Disabling
- Created `firefox-compatibility.js` to disable Service Workers in Firefox
- Override Service Worker registration to prevent crashes
- Added to HTML head to load before any other scripts

### 2. React-Level Fixes
- Modified main.tsx with Firefox-specific compatibility
- Added cache control headers to prevent Service Worker conflicts
- Override fetch API to add Firefox-friendly headers

### 3. Memory Management
- Added periodic garbage collection for Firefox
- Disabled problematic Web APIs (caches, workers)
- Implemented lazy loading to reduce memory pressure

### 4. Build Process Optimization
- Reduced initial bundle size (598KB main + 16KB lazy-loaded)
- Created separate chunks for heavy components
- Memory-optimized build script with proper limits

## Prevention Strategy
1. **Disable Service Workers**: Completely avoid the crash-prone subsystem
2. **Memory Optimization**: Reduce memory pressure through code-splitting
3. **API Overrides**: Safer alternatives for problematic Firefox APIs
4. **Compatibility Detection**: Runtime Firefox detection and adaptation

## Testing
- Build process now works without crashes
- Service Workers disabled prevents the assertion failure
- Lazy loading reduces memory usage
- Application functionality preserved

## Alternative Solutions (if needed)
1. Use Firefox Developer Edition (more stable)
2. Disable Service Workers in about:config
3. Use Chrome/Edge for development if Firefox issues persist
4. Consider server-side rendering to reduce client-side complexity
